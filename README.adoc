# Data center IP ranges / CIDRs

image::https://github.com/jhassine/datacenters/workflows/Update%20CIDRs/badge.svg?branch=master[Status]

Daily updated list of IP addresses / CIDR blocks used by data centers, cloud service providers, servers, etc.

Essentially the IP addresses where an average web user should not be accessing from. Useful for detecting or limiting the traffic from servers.

## Usage

There are two formats of the data available which are updated daily:

1. The CSV format which contain more details: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jhassine/datacenters/master/data/datacenters.csv

2. The text format which contain only the CIDR block: https://github.com/jhassine/datacenters/blob/master/data/datacenters.txt

## Contributions are welcomed
